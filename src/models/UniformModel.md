# UniformModels
UniformModels are models where each instance shares the same shape and material

## General Structure
*Uniform models may only have 2 meshes*, a main mesh and a shadow mesh.
The main mesh describes the shape of the model and the shadow mesh
is just a pre-rendered cache of the model's shadow *which is not required*

## Expansions
The following model types follow the same rules as UniformModels:

- UniformModel
- RailedModel
