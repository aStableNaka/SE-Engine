# User-Interface specification

## General

### Core design

- Mouse first design
- Simple and consistent
- Data views should be clear and modifiable
- Update-as-needed
- Keybinds and rebinds should clearly state their action

#### Mouse First Design
Every action the user can take should be able to be accomplished by the mouse alone.

#### Simple and consistent
The UI should not distract the user from the game context and should clearly
depict the effect that will occur given any action

#### Data views should be clear and modifiable
The user should be able to have full control over what kind of data they wish to see
and where they wish to have it located. These modifications should be saved on a 
per-gamesave basis

#### Update as needed
The information displayed on any GUI should not be polled. Information should
be updated using event listeners

#### Keybinds and rebinds
The rebind menu should show a mock of the GUI it acts on that clearly displays the
effect of a rebind.
